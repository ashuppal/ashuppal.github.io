What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

While selecting which data structure to use, it is important to take into account what are the operations we are going to perform 
and how often they are going to be executed. You may have to consider what is most important while using a data structure : 
memory use, performance, and ease of use are the most important.

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

For avoiding an infinite recursive call stack you should have a base case where when the condition is satisfied the 
function stops making new recursive calls. If there is no base case then the function calls will never stop and eventually a stack overflow will occur.
