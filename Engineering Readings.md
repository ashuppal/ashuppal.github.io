### Engineering Readings ###

What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I was working as an Educator before changing career. Even though I am new in this career, I have multiple certifications 
on various languages and platforms. I have done complex project to improve my skills. My previous experience as a teacher 
and also as a curriculum lead gives me an unique perspective about meeting deadlines, managing people and becoming a 
motivated leader. My professional experiences, coupled with my good communication skills, work ethic, 
and friendly attitude, makes me a perfect fit for the job.

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

The first and the most important thing is to understand the problem completely.Read the problem several times until 
you can explain it to someone else. After that try to solve the problem manually. Think how you will solve the problem 
as a human and write steos(pseudocode). After that writing code will become easier. And from the past experience, I will 
try to get a working solution first without making it complex. Refactoring can be done if you have a working solution.
