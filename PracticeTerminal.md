The Command Line What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. First, you will enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and output will be given to you similarly as text. Most commands produce output and it will be listed straight under the issuing of the command.
How do I get one:  
Mac: you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities.
Linux: Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities.
Windows: you will need an SSH client.

Basic Navigation - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.

While working in the terminal, we need to know in which directory we are currently working and what all the files located under it.
Some basic commands:
pwd: Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
ls: List the contents of a directory.
cd: Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
ls -a :List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
Relative path : A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
Absolute path : A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept.

We can manipulate files using following commands:
mkdir : Make Directory - ie. Create a directory.
rmdir : Remove Directory - ie. Delete a directory.
touch : Create a blank file.
cp : Copy - ie. Copy a file or directory.
mv : Move - ie. Move a file or directory (can also be used to rename).
rm : Remove - ie. Delete a file.
