Next.js:

Server-side rendering: Next.js is a server-side rendering (SSR) framework for React. This means that it allows you to render your React components on the server before they are sent to the client's browser. SSR can help with improving your website's performance, search engine optimization (SEO), and accessibility. It can also help with initial page load times, especially for websites with a lot of dynamic content.

Automatic code splitting: Next.js comes with built-in automatic code splitting, which means that it automatically splits your code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This can help with improving your website's performance by reducing the amount of code that needs to be downloaded by the client's browser. It also helps with lazy loading, which can further reduce initial page load times.

 Gatsby.js:

Static site generator: Gatsby.js is a static site generator (SSG) that allows you to build static websites using React. With Gatsby, you can create websites that are fast, secure, and highly customizable. Gatsby generates static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be served directly to the client's browser, which can help with improving your website's performance and security.

GraphQL integration: Gatsby.js has built-in integration with GraphQL, which is a powerful query language for APIs. With Gatsby, you can use GraphQL to query data from various sources, including APIs, databases, and local files. This allows you to easily pull data from multiple sources and combine them into a single GraphQL schema, which can be used to generate pages and components. The GraphQL integration also allows you to optimize your website's performance by only querying the data that you need, and by caching the results of your queries.
