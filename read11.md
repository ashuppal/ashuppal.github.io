#### Event Driven Programming

What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
The events module allows us to get started with Even Driven Programming.

What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit and EDP allows 
for a more reactive and responsive programming style, where the application can respond to events as they occur rather than 
following a strict, sequential program flow.


Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
If you have an application where you want to let people download some data/ pictures etc. which can take time. Users should be able to use the app until the
data is downloaded.In this case you can use EDP where you can create an event that gets triggered when the data is done downloading.
